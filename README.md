# Godot .Net DogeCreeps
### Description

This overall purpose of this game is to showcase the various essentials of making a .Net based game in the Godot 4 Engine. The game 'Dodge Creeps' is about roaming a void space where you avoid collision with enemies to reach a high score. This includes graphics, input, signals, GUI, and other basics of the engine. To see progress at each lesson you can view the sub-branches which show the project code at the end of that lesson number. The master branch has the final product. 

### Testing

#### Playing Executable (Windows-Only)
Godot 4 .NET currently only supports Desktop applications (as of 2024), and this application was built primarily to target Windows so this is reccomended. Download the build folder and unzip the "FirstGame_windows_x86_x64" folder. Run the console executable on windows to play the game as a desktop application stand-alone.

#### Playing In Engine
Running this in the godot engine require Godot 4 .NET downloaded and installed. This also means installing .NET SDK v6.0. Once those pre-requisites are installed, clone the project and open the project.godot file in the Godot engine. Press the run button to auto-start the main scene and play the game.
